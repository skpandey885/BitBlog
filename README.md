**Key Features of BitBlog:** 
1. **User Registration and Authentication:** - Users can create new accounts with unique usernames and passwords. Registered users can log in securely to access personalized features. Passwords should be securely hashed and stored.
2. **User Profile Page:** - Each registered user has a profile page displaying their username and basic information. Users can update their profile information, such as a profile picture and bio. Profile pages serve as a hub for users to view their own posts and comments. 
3. **Text-Based Blog Posts:** - Registered users can create, edit, and delete text-based blog posts. Each blog post includes a title, author, date, and body text. Posts are displayed in a user-friendly format on the main blog page. 
4. **Text Editing:** - Users can edit their existing blog posts, making changes to the title or content as needed. This feature encourages content refinement and updates over time.
5. **Text Deletion:** - Authors can delete their own blog posts when they choose to remove content.
